    "\n",
    "**Your Task:** Below you'll find the `Node` and `LinkedList` class you saw in the lectures. Your job is to work alongside an LLM to update this class to be a doubly linked list, meaning each node has connections to both its previous and next node. Once you've done that, work with the LLM to further refine the class to account for other concerns common in software engineering like security concerns or scalability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM Access:** You can access OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-generative-ai-for-software-development/ungradedLab/Vuqvf/gpt-3-5-environment), but feel free to use the LLM you want!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practice Prompting:** Focus on trying out the prompting skills covered in the lectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Be Specific:** In your prompts provide detail about what you're trying to accomplish and the context in which you're working. For example, it'd be totally appropriate to provide the LLM the class as it's already written and describe the new functionality you're trying to add.\n",
    "* **Provide Feedback:** Iteratively prompt the LLM and provide feedback on the output you receive to get closer to your expected results. In this case, you could try the code you develop alongside the LLM and report back on bugs, unexpected behavior, or stylistic decisions you want improved.\n",
    "* **Assign a Role:** Assign a role to tailor the output you receive from the LLM. At first you might just want to assign the role of \"an experienced Python developer\" but later on try out more specific or expert roles to focus on areas like security or scalability. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing Your Class:** At the bottom of this notebook you'll find different test cases that will help determine if your class works as expected. This lab is ungraded, however, so you don't need to pass all the test cases to move on. Focus instead on exploring what coding alongside an LLM is like, trying the prompting skills, and building your own intuitive sense of how LLMs will best fit into your software development workflow."
